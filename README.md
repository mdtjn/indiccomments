IndicComments
=============

Introduction
------------
Indic Comments is a standalone commenting system that provides commenting in all indic scripts. Installing this Wordpress plugin would replace the default wordpress commenting system. It allows user to login with Facebook and post comment. Every page has a unique identity against which the user’s comment and facebook uid is stored.

Code details

* Team - Himanshu Mittal, Mudit Jain, Prashant Nirgun
* GitHub Repo https://github.com/mdtjn/indiccomments/

Road Map
--------

* Improve UI
* Offer the commenting box as iframe. Right now installing the facebook app is linked to a particular URL and plugin does not work on other URLs. Using iframe we can have the same facebook authentication work across URLs
* Provide like buttons on comments and have threaded commenting system
* Provide spam filter and comment moderation
* Provide the plugin for multiple Content Management Systems - blogger, joomla, drupal etc
